"""
Regression test for CLAUDE.md design decision #5 ("response function is
swappable by contract"): swapping ``echofit.model.response_function`` must
be honoured by *both* fitting and ``EchoFit.plot_lightcurve_fits()``.

It previously wasn't -- ``echofit.py`` had its own independent
``from .forward_model import response_function`` import, so a swap on
``model.py`` changed what NUTS fit but not what the plot re-derived psi
from, silently producing a plot inconsistent with the actual fit.
