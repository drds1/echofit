"""
Deterministic (no MCMC) test of the identifiability claim documented in
model.py's module docstring: shifting the driver by any Delta, compensated
by shifting every band's response lag by -Delta, leaves the predicted light
curve exactly unchanged for a free-lag (independent, not physically-tied)
response -- which is exactly why such a fit needs a driver light curve to
anchor the absolute lag scale. This checks the forward model directly
(fast, exact, no sampling noise) rather than inferring it indirectly from
an MCMC fit's behaviour.
